Introduction to Shell Scripting
===============================================================================

- Basics of Shell Scripting with Bash
--------------------------------------
    - Overview:
        - Shell scripting is a powerful way to automate tasks and perform repetitive tasks in a Unix-like environment.
        - Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is the default shell on most Linux distributions and is widely used for scripting.

    - Key Concepts:
        - Variables: Variables store data that can be used later in the script. They can store strings, numbers, or any other data type.
        - Loops: Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. Common types of loops include for loops and while loops.
        - Conditionals: Conditionals allow you to make decisions in your script based on certain conditions. Common conditional statements include if statements and case statements.
        - Functions: Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be called multiple times within a script. They help in organizing and modularizing your code.

    - Practice Tasks:
        1. Variables:
            - Declare and initialize variables of different data types (string, integer, etc.).
            - Print the values of variables using the 'echo' command.
        2. Loops:
            - Write a for loop to iterate over a range of numbers or elements in an array.
            - Write a while loop to repeat a block of code until a condition is met.
        3. Conditionals:
            - Use if statements to check conditions and execute different code blocks based on the result.
            - Use case statements to perform different actions based on the value of a variable.
        4. Functions:
            - Define a function that takes parameters and returns a value.
            - Call the function with different arguments and capture the return value.

    - Example Script:
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash

        # Variables
        name="John"
        age=30

        # Loops
        for i in {1..5}; do
            echo "Iteration $i"
        done

        # Conditionals
        if [ $age -ge 18 ]; then
            echo "$name is an adult."
        else
            echo "$name is a minor."
        fi

        # Functions
        greet() {
            local person_name=$1
            echo "Hello, $person_name!"
        }

        greet "Alice"
        ```
