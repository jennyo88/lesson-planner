Practice Scripting for Automation
===============================================================================

- Automating Tasks with Shell Scripts
--------------------------------------
    - Overview:
        - Shell scripts provide a convenient way to automate repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency and reducing manual effort.
        - This lesson focuses on practicing writing shell scripts to automate various tasks such as file manipulation, backups, or system monitoring.

    - Key Concepts:
        - Script Structure: Understanding the basic structure of a shell script, including shebang (#!/bin/bash), comments, and executable permissions.
        - File Manipulation: Using commands like cp, mv, rm, and mkdir to manipulate files and directories.
        - Backup Automation: Writing scripts to automate backup tasks, including creating backups, rotating backups, and handling error conditions.
        - System Monitoring: Implementing scripts to monitor system resources such as CPU usage, disk space, and network connectivity.

    - Practice Tasks:
        1. File Manipulation:
            - Write a script to move files from one directory to another based on certain conditions (e.g., file extension, file size).
            - Create a script to recursively delete files older than a specified number of days from a directory.
        2. Backup Automation:
            - Develop a backup script that creates a compressed archive of specified files and directories and stores it in a backup directory.
            - Implement a backup rotation mechanism to manage multiple backup versions and prevent disk space issues.
        3. System Monitoring:
            - Write a script to monitor CPU usage and send an email notification if it exceeds a predefined threshold.
            - Create a script to check disk space usage and alert if any filesystem exceeds a specified threshold.

    - Example Script:
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash

        # Backup Script
        backup_dir="/backup"
        source_dir="/data"
        date_stamp=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
        backup_file="backup_$date_stamp.tar.gz"

        tar -czf "$backup_dir/$backup_file" "$source_dir"
        ```
