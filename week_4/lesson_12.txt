Exploring Advanced Scripting Concepts
===============================================================================

- Advanced Scripting Techniques
--------------------------------
    - Overview:
        - Advanced scripting techniques enhance the functionality and robustness of shell scripts, allowing for more sophisticated automation solutions.
        - This lesson explores advanced scripting concepts such as error handling and command-line arguments to further extend the capabilities of shell scripts.

    - Key Concepts:
        - Error Handling: Implementing error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected errors and failures in shell scripts.
        - Command-Line Arguments: Parsing command-line arguments passed to a script to customize its behavior and functionality.
        - Logging: Utilizing logging techniques to record script execution information, errors, and debugging messages.
        - Signal Handling: Managing signals sent to a script by the operating system or other processes, allowing for graceful termination or specific actions.

    - Practice Tasks:
        1. Error Handling:
            - Enhance existing scripts with error handling mechanisms to handle common error scenarios, such as file not found or permission denied.
            - Implement robust error reporting mechanisms, including logging errors to a file or sending email notifications.
        2. Command-Line Arguments:
            - Modify scripts to accept command-line arguments for customization of behavior, such as input file paths, output directories, or verbosity levels.
            - Implement argument validation to ensure proper usage and provide informative usage instructions when incorrect arguments are provided.
        3. Logging:
            - Integrate logging functionality into scripts to capture important events, errors, and debugging information.
            - Customize log formats and levels based on the script's requirements and deployment environment.
        4. Signal Handling:
            - Write scripts that gracefully handle signals like SIGINT (Ctrl+C) or SIGTERM for clean shutdown and cleanup operations.
            - Implement custom signal handlers to perform specific actions in response to signals received during script execution.

    - Example Script:
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash

        # Error Handling
        if [ ! -f "$input_file" ]; then
            echo "Error: Input file not found." >&2
            exit 1
        fi

        # Command-Line Arguments
        while getopts ":i:o:v" opt; do
            case $opt in
                i) input_file="$OPTARG" ;;
                o) output_dir="$OPTARG" ;;
                v) verbose=true ;;
                \?) echo "Invalid option: -$OPTARG" >&2 ;;
            esac
        done

        # Logging
        log_file="/var/log/my_script.log"
        echo "$(date): Script execution started." >> "$log_file"

        # Signal Handling
        trap 'cleanup' EXIT

        cleanup() {
            echo "Cleaning up resources..."
            # Add cleanup logic here
        }
        ```
