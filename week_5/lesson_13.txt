Learning Basic Networking Commands
===============================================================================

- Basic Networking Commands
--------------------------------
    - Overview:
        - Basic networking commands are essential for diagnosing and managing network connections in a Linux environment.
        - This lesson covers fundamental networking commands such as ifconfig, ping, and traceroute, along with understanding network configuration files like /etc/network/interfaces.

    - Key Commands:
        - ifconfig: Displays network interface configuration details, including IP addresses, netmasks, and hardware addresses.
        - ping: Sends ICMP echo requests to a specified network host to check connectivity and measure round-trip time.
        - traceroute: Traces the route that packets take to reach a destination host, showing intermediate hops and response times.
        - /etc/network/interfaces: Configuration file used to define network interfaces and their settings, including IP addresses, gateways, and DNS servers.

    - Practice Tasks:
        1. Using ifconfig:
            - Use ifconfig to display network interface details such as IP addresses, netmasks, and MAC addresses.
            - Configure and assign IP addresses to network interfaces using ifconfig.
        2. Testing Connectivity with ping:
            - Use ping to test connectivity to remote hosts by sending ICMP echo requests and receiving replies.
            - Experiment with different options of ping, such as setting the packet size or specifying the number of packets to send.
        3. Tracing Network Routes with traceroute:
            - Trace the route that packets take to reach a specific destination host using traceroute.
            - Analyze the output to identify network hops, response times, and potential connectivity issues.
        4. Network Configuration with /etc/network/interfaces:
            - Explore the /etc/network/interfaces file and understand its structure and syntax.
            - Modify network interface configurations, such as assigning static IP addresses or configuring DHCP.

    - Example Usage:
        ```bash
        # Display network interface details
        ifconfig

        # Ping a remote host
        ping google.com

        # Trace the route to a remote host
        traceroute google.com

        # Edit network interface configuration
        sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
        ```
