Exploring System Security Measures
===============================================================================

- System Security Fundamentals
--------------------------------
    - Overview:
        - System security is crucial for protecting sensitive data and ensuring the integrity and availability of resources.
        - This lesson explores fundamental system security measures, focusing on basic firewall management using iptables and user authentication techniques.

    - Key Concepts:
        - Firewall Management with iptables: Understanding iptables, a powerful firewall utility for filtering network traffic and implementing access control policies.
        - User Authentication: Exploring user authentication mechanisms, including password-based authentication, SSH key authentication, and user management best practices.

    - Practice Tasks:
        1. Basic Firewall Configuration with iptables:
            - Learn to use iptables to set up basic firewall rules, such as allowing or denying specific network traffic based on source/destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
            - Experiment with iptables commands to block unwanted incoming connections, allow essential services, and log firewall activity.
        2. User Authentication and Management:
            - Configure password-based authentication for user accounts, enforcing strong password policies and periodic password changes.
            - Implement SSH key-based authentication for secure remote access, generating SSH key pairs, and configuring SSH server settings.
            - Practice user management tasks such as adding, modifying, and removing user accounts, setting user permissions, and managing user groups.

    - Example Usage:
        ```bash
        # Display current iptables rules
        sudo iptables -L

        # Allow SSH connections (port 22)
        sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

        # Deny incoming connections from a specific IP address
        sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.100 -j DROP

        # Enable SSH key authentication for a user
        ssh-copy-id username@remote_host

        # Add a new user to the system
        sudo adduser newuser

        # Modify user permissions and groups
        sudo usermod -aG groupname username
        ```
