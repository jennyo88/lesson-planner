- Reviewing System Security and Networking
-------------------------------------------
    - Overview:
        - Reviewing system security and networking is essential for reinforcing knowledge and ensuring effective implementation of security measures.
        - This lesson focuses on reviewing previously learned concepts related to system security and networking and providing opportunities for hands-on practice.

    - Key Areas of Review:
        - System Security Review:
            - Revisit fundamental system security concepts, including firewall management, user authentication, and access control.
            - Review best practices for securing network services, such as SSH, HTTP, and FTP, and mitigating common security threats.
        - Networking Review:
            - Recap basic networking concepts, including IP addressing, subnetting, DNS resolution, and network protocols.
            - Review essential networking commands, such as ifconfig, ping, traceroute, and netstat, and their practical usage.
        - Practice Sessions:
            - Hands-on exercises to reinforce system security and networking skills, including configuring firewall rules, implementing user authentication, and troubleshooting network connectivity issues.

    - Practice Tasks:
        1. Firewall Configuration:
            - Configure iptables rules to allow/deny specific network traffic based on predefined criteria.
            - Test firewall rules by simulating various network scenarios and verifying expected behavior.
        2. User Authentication:
            - Set up password-based and SSH key-based authentication for user accounts.
            - Perform user management tasks, including creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts, and assigning appropriate permissions.
        3. Network Troubleshooting:
            - Troubleshoot common network connectivity issues using diagnostic tools like ping, traceroute, and netstat.
            - Analyze network configuration files and logs to identify and resolve networking problems.

    - Example Exercise:
        - Configure a firewall to allow SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) traffic while blocking all other incoming connections.
        - Set up SSH key-based authentication for a user account and disable password-based authentication.
        - Troubleshoot a network connectivity issue between two hosts and restore connectivity using appropriate troubleshooting steps.
