Troubleshooting Techniques
===============================================================================

- Troubleshooting Essentials
--------------------------------
    - Overview:
        - Troubleshooting is a critical skill for system administrators to identify and resolve issues efficiently, minimizing downtime and ensuring system stability.
        - This lesson covers the basics of troubleshooting, including log file analysis, system diagnostics, and recovery methods.

    - Key Concepts:
        - Understanding the Basics of Troubleshooting: Learning systematic approaches to identify, isolate, and resolve issues methodically.
        - Log File Analysis: Utilizing log files generated by the system and applications to diagnose problems and track system events.
        - System Diagnostics: Using built-in diagnostic tools and commands to assess system health, identify hardware/software issues, and monitor performance.
        - System Recovery Methods: Implementing recovery strategies to restore system functionality in case of failures or disasters.

    - Practice Tasks:
        1. Troubleshooting Process:
            - Familiarize yourself with the troubleshooting process, including defining the problem, gathering information, isolating the cause, and implementing a solution.
            - Practice using systematic troubleshooting techniques to address common system issues, such as network connectivity problems, service failures, or disk space shortages.
        2. Log File Analysis:
            - Learn to interpret log files generated by the system and applications, including system logs (syslog), Apache/Nginx logs, database logs, etc.
            - Identify error messages, warnings, and critical events in log files and correlate them with specific issues or symptoms.
        3. System Diagnostics:
            - Explore built-in diagnostic tools and commands available in Linux, such as dmesg, top, vmstat, sar, and meminfo, to gather system performance data and identify potential bottlenecks or abnormalities.
            - Practice using diagnostic tools to monitor CPU usage, memory utilization, disk I/O, network traffic, and other system metrics.
        4. System Recovery:
            - Implement recovery methods to restore system functionality in case of failures or disasters, including system backups, disaster recovery plans, and failover mechanisms.
            - Practice system recovery scenarios, such as restoring from backups, recovering corrupted filesystems, or recovering from system crashes.

    - Example Usage:
        ```bash
        # View system logs (syslog)
        tail /var/log/syslog

        # Check system resource usage
        top

        # Analyze disk space usage
        df -h

        # Check network connectivity
        ping google.com

        # View kernel messages
        dmesg | tail
        ```
