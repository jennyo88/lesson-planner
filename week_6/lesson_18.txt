- Testing Troubleshooting Skills
--------------------------------
    - Overview:
        - Testing troubleshooting skills is crucial for validating knowledge and honing problem-solving abilities in real-world scenarios.
        - This lesson focuses on hands-on exercises to simulate common system issues and practice troubleshooting techniques.

    - Key Objectives:
        - Simulating Common Issues: Create simulated scenarios representing common system problems, such as network connectivity issues, service failures, or hardware malfunctions.
        - Applying Troubleshooting Techniques: Utilize systematic troubleshooting approaches to identify root causes, isolate issues, and implement effective solutions.
        - Hands-on Practice: Engage in practical exercises to troubleshoot simulated problems, emphasizing critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

    - Practice Tasks:
        1. Network Connectivity Issues:
            - Simulate network connectivity problems, such as DNS resolution failures, IP address conflicts, or firewall misconfigurations.
            - Apply troubleshooting techniques to diagnose and resolve network-related issues, including verifying network configurations, checking connectivity, and analyzing network traffic.
        2. Service Failures:
            - Create scenarios where essential services (e.g., SSH, Apache, MySQL) encounter failures due to misconfigurations, resource constraints, or software bugs.
            - Practice troubleshooting service failures by examining service logs, verifying service configurations, and restarting or repairing services as needed.
        3. Hardware Malfunctions:
            - Simulate hardware-related issues such as disk failures, memory errors, or CPU overheating.
            - Use diagnostic tools and hardware monitoring utilities to identify faulty hardware components, perform hardware diagnostics, and initiate remedial actions.

    - Example Scenarios:
        - Scenario 1: Unable to access a web server (Apache) due to misconfigured firewall rules.
        - Scenario 2: Database (MySQL) service fails to start after a system update due to incorrect configuration settings.
        - Scenario 3: System experiences frequent crashes and freezes attributed to overheating CPU or insufficient memory.

    - Evaluation Criteria:
        - Accuracy in diagnosing issues and identifying root causes.
        - Efficiency in implementing solutions and restoring system functionality.
        - Adherence to best practices and systematic troubleshooting methodologies.
